    <p>Many current approaches to discourse analysis privilege the speech event, presupposing that key social patterns are established in individual events. Even work that explores “intertextuality” typically explores links among events in order to analyze the meaning of individual events or recurring types of events. Recent work by Lemke, Agha and others, however, has described how discourse connects across speech events, how signs and individuals travel across trajectories and how events link to each other at various scales. This work has shown how linked speech events are essential to social life. Social identities, for example, have often been seen as characteristic positionings or representations that occur in discrete speech events and then recur. It has now become clear that social identification requires linkages across events. These chains or trajectories across linked events represent a new unit of analysis. This paper describes a new approach to discourse analysis. Most discourse analytic work focuses on bounded speech events -- conversations, narratives, jokes, interviews and the like. This can be productive, but it cannot capture social patterns that emerge across events. This paper argues that discourse analysts should look beyond discrete speech events to examine pathways of linked events. Drawing on theories and methods from linguistic anthropology, the paper presents a systematic methodological approach to doing discourse analysis across chains of events.</p>
