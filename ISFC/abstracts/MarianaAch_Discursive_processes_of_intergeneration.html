    <p>What do youth know about the recent past? How do they learn about it? What discursive processes and semiotic work is involved in this social activity? This presentation reports on findings from a linguistic ethnography project exploring how youth learn about older generations’ historical experience and social memory through engagement with narratives that circulate in various contexts: home, school and popular culture. I will show how intergenerational transmission of recent history occurs through discursive practices like recontextualization (Bernstein, 2000) and resemiotization (Iedema, 2003) resulting in youth’s transformative appropriation of discourses. The case of Uruguayan youth learning about the last civil-military dictatorship (1973-1985) serves to show how a contested past is transmitted to younger generations who were not direct participants in the events. Through the analysis of interviews and documents I will show how the transmission of the past requires the active semiotic work of individuals and groups through time. The findings reveal that discourse plays an important part in the social memory transmission process by materializing events and actors that are no longer with us to mobilize them in the service of present objectives.</p>
