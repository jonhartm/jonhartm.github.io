  <div class="container-content">
    <p>Global migration and communication have resulted in the urgent need to assess L2 users’ ability to create appropriate meanings in specific workplace and academic contexts, an ability that is often referred to as ‘pragmatic competence.’
Although pragmatic competence is, in some fashion, assessed all the time, important questions remain whether what is being assessed is, in fact, ‘pragmatic competence’ relevant to the intended register of language use (e.g., business English, academic German writing). Such validation research typically begins with statements that the test measures the construct of ‘pragmatic competence’ and that scores are useful in a particular context.
Framing the issue in this way highlights significant challenges. First, if pragmatic competence is the construct underlying the validation research, a theoretically defensible and practically useful definition needs to be specified. Second, to support validation research the definition of pragmatics needs to provide guidance for the linguistic analysis of test takers’ language performance. However, to date, in language assessment pragmatic competence has been portrayed in diverse ways, often as a component of language knowledge. The conception of pragmatics as a component of knowledge that underlies performance in context provides only limited guidance to researchers wanting to conduct theoretically motivated linguistic analysis of test responses and, ultimately, to the language studies field as a whole.
The three papers in this session address these theoretical, analytic, and practice-oriented demands from various perspectives in order to explore productive paths for research on how to conceptualize and assess linguistic meaning-making in specific workplace and academic contexts.

Introduction: Carol A. Chapelle

Toward a construct definition of the pragmatics of workplace English
Veronika Timpe-Laughlin and Jonathan Schmidgall

This paper will provide an overview of pragmatics in the language use domain “English-medium workplace.” It will outline commonly identified constitutive components of pragmatics found in the literature and reconceptualize them into a proposed construct of pragmatic competence. Challenges of operationalizing pragmatic competence in both instruction and assessment are discussed.

Assessing the pragmatics of speaking in online communication
Marianna Ryshina-Pankova

This study of synchronous telecollaborative chats by American learners of German and students at a German university investigated intercultural communicative competence (ICC) as an ability to structure oral-like chats in terms of particular conversation moves. The study found that the type and frequency of certain moves contribute to the development of ICC, as they allow for interactional balance, depth, and questioning of cultural assumptions.

Uncovering pragmatic competence in speaking through corpus-based register analysis
Geoffrey T. LaFlair, Shelley Staples, and Jesse Egbert

We used corpus-based register analysis to compare discourse from 98 interactive speaking tests to discourse from academic, workplace, and conversational target domains. High scoring test takers used indicators of pragmatic competence such as stance features (e.g., epistemic adverbs and hedges) more than low scoring test takers and at rates similar to workplace and academic target domains.
