    <p>In Sorley MacLean’s poem Hallaig, it is &#34;a vehement bullet from the gun of love” that slays time, the running deer, and unites the generations passed in a single perpetual moment that transcends the despoilment of the island clachan that gives the poem its name.  This transcendental quality is, however, firmly rooted in the local, across space and genealogy: in the Sgreapadal of the poet’s people, from the time of MacGilleChaluim, the first clan chief of Raasay, to the villagers Tormod and Eachann Mòr, and the native trees that are the boys and girls still populating the abandoned village. Through these devices the poet creates a location in time-and-space in which he, as inhabitant and descendent, speaks with a legitimate voice.

Such location of literary works in space and time was termed a chronotope by the Russian critic Mikhail Bakhtin (1981 [1937]), and the concept has more recently entered into the sociolinguistic literature on globalisation through the writings of Blommaert (2015) and others.  The focus of the later work is often on the crisis of chronotopic legitimacy in the era of globalisation, the limits on the transportability of texts across boundaries, and the means by which these texts can be reformulated to gain legitimacy at different scales.

These same issues, though as yet unnamed, were encountered in his day by Sorley MacLean as he sought to extend the chronotopic range of his poetry while maintaining the legitimacy of his island voice.  This he achieved, firstly, through his explorations of the crises besetting inter-war Europe in the terms of his own people and, most startlingly, the topology of his native Raasay and Skye; and, secondly, through his translation of his poetry from his native Gaelic voice into an English equivalent. In this way we see a rescaling of his poetry in terms of both his chronotopic legitimacy and the scope of his audience.

In more prosaic terms, and returning to the sociolinguistic theme, we see in discourses of development a similar struggle over legitimacy as community activists seek to transpose their intensive, lived understanding of local issues into the extensive and impersonal language of politicians and policymakers – and vice versa – and the different relevances afforded to time and space within the different discourses.

Turning to the theme of the Congress: as ‘applying linguists’ committed to social change and promoting discourse across difference, we need to be aware of the different scales at which discourses operate and the different – often multiple - centres to which participants – including ourselves as analysts - orient and legitimate their voices.

In this presentation I take MacLean’s poem Hallaig as a starting point to explore ideas of scale, chronotope and legitimacy, making links along the way to previous fieldwork in the rainforest of Guyana (Bartlett 2012) and the Western Isles of Scotland (Singh and Bartlett 2017).  In doing so, I hope to open up a space to explore the ways in which SFL approaches to text and context, as applied to social issues, can both contribute to and benefit from current work in the wider field of social linguistics.
