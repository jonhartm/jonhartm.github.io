    <p>The SFL understanding of register, dialect, code and genre has enabled researchers to develop descriptions of “advancedness” in second language literacy development that have greatly informed research on literacy development in heritage languages, second languages, and foreign languages (e.g., Schleppegrell &amp; Colombi, 2004; Byrnes, 2006). In this plenary, Colombi and Schleppegrell will review advances in the study of advanced L2 literacy in Spanish and English that have been influenced by SFL-inspired research over the past 20 years and identify current foci and challenges in this research. They will show how recognizing variation in language users and contexts and greater understanding of the challenges of different contexts of schooling have reoriented research toward more fully articulated and contextually situated linguistic analyses of learners’ written and spoken language that are currently shaping research and pedagogy.

 
The fruits of these efforts, drawing on such SFL-inspired constructs as grammatical metaphor, are influencing research in advanced language learning from other traditions as well (e.g., Ortega, 2015). In addition, current work on disciplinary differences and multiliteracies across traditions of research is increasingly drawing on concepts from SFL. The speakers will share perspectives from their own research and that of others to lay out a research agenda toward continued development of our understanding of the ways learners develop proficiency in additional languages for academic and professional purposes.
