    <p>Over the course of two major research projects SFL and LCT have engaged in a productive transdisciplinary dialogue, focusing in large part on knowledge building. This dialogue has challenged SFL perspectives on ideational meaning, across the levels of register (field), discourse semantics (ideation) and lexicogrammar (ideational resources). This paper engages with responses to some of these challenges, LCT&#39;s positional and relational autonomy in particular. It reviews recent work by Doran and Martin on field, and considers how this model can be deployed to describe field shifting in secondary school discourse – focusing on analogy and lexical metaphor. A model of field shifting is developed, drawing on SFL&#39;s Bernstein&#39;s concepts of regulatory and instructional discourse and their recontextualisation in SFL as the projection of disciplinary knowledge in pedagogic practice.</p>
