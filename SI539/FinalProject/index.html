<h2>My Suggestions</h2>
<div class="text-container">
  <ul>
    <li class="suggestion-title">Suggestion 1: Use Correct HTML for the content.</li>
    <p>
      The individual sections contain an H5 element, indicating the category, under which is a series of H2 elements, one for each individual alumni. Although design-wise, it appears to be intended for the category headers to be of a smaller font than the content, this violates the intention of the headers, which is to create a “hierarchy of headline importance”. As the page topic is “Notable Alumni”, indicated by an H1 tag, categories should be H2, and the content within should be H3. Stylistic choices, such as font size, should be applied using CSS. In the same category, there are several empty H4 elements with the class "widgettitle" at the bottom of the page, which appear to be leftover from a previous design of the page. These should be removed if they are not used.
    </p>
    <li class="suggestion-title">Suggestion 2: Support Keyboard Navigation</li>
    <p>
      Although javascript exists to provide keyboard navigation shortcuts for “Skip to Content” and “Skip to Navigation” upon pressing the tab key, it is not possible to actually view the content by using the keyboard. There should be some way, via tabbing, to expand and traverse the information contained in each topic. This could be done by assigning tab indices to each of the category titles (currently the H5 elements), and assigning the current accordion expansion action to occur on “onfocus” as well as “onclick”
    </p>
    <li class="suggestion-title">Suggestion 3: Make Links descriptive</li>
    <p>
      There are a series of links in the footer of the page for various social networks, however the only indication for where each link leads is the font-awesome icon for each and the href link within the anchor tag. At the very least, each tag should contain text for the name of the website next to the icon to assist with screen readers.
    </p>
    <li class="suggestion-title">Suggestion 4: Links should be visually identifiable and have clear :focus and :active states</li>
    <p>
      Links within the content of the page do not have any indication that they are in fact links. There is a slight difference in color from the rest of the text, but until the mouse hovers over a link and an underline appears, it is not particularly obvious which names are links and which are not. Additionally, there is no change in appearance for a link which has an “active” state. CSS styles should be applied to assign different visual indications for these links, either by a change in color, background or style, in order to differentiate them from non-link text.
    </p>
    <li class="suggestion-title">Suggestion 5: Help users understand inputs, and help them avoid and correct mistakes</li>
    <p>
      The page contains two forms, each preceded with a magnifying glass icon, the text “search” and containing a single textbox. In the desktop view with styles applied, only one of these search forms can be accessed via javascript, however a screen reader would see both forms. They perform the same task, however it is not apparent from the text surrounding the input field what exactly the form is for. The duplicate, unused form should be removed from the page, and the remaining form should contain a label tag for the textbox, indicating the purpose of the form (e.g. "Search the Alumni Website"). Additionally, this form lacks a "submit" button. When navigating by keyboard it is not immediately obvious that one should hit "enter" to trigger a search, and pressing “tab” moves the user out of the form and onto another part of the page. Providing a clear input option would help users understand the operation of the form.
