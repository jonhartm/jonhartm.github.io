        This project is a cumulative assesment of course content covered in
        SI671 - Dataming. Parameters for the project were fairly loose - we were
        asked to locate a data source we considered interesting, and apply a variety
        of analysis in order to create some sort of predictive method. Evaluation
        was based on the quality of the analysis, as well as a type final report
        covering a project overview, methods, evaluation, and conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
        My project in particular focused on the
        <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdi/">NOAA's Severe Weather Data Inventory</a>,
        a collection of nearly every severe weather event affecting the United States
        from 1950 to present day, and which included a wide variety of geospatial
        and temporal information. My analysis focused on creating sub-selections of
        data based on event type and date and collecting the resulting events into
        a matrix representation of the continental United States. Collecting that
        data by county, I then applied a Gettis-Ord-G autocorrelation statistic
        in order to attempt to locate significant patterns. A detailed account of
        the methodology and results can be found in the Final Report PDF linked below.

        This project is an implementation of a search system on a small scale. In
        this instance, we collected every tweet made by a currently serving
        Congressperson, index them by sender, and implemented a simple flask
        application interface to allow a user to perform searches. The Python
        "Woosh" library was leveraged to allow indexing and searching, however as
        tweets are by their nature very short, a simple Okapi-BM25 search is
        inadequate to capture relevant tweets. To address this, we applied Latent
        Sematic Analysis over the indexed tweets to identify strongly related terms
        and expand the initial query, which increased precision significantly in
        our final product.

        This project used comments collected from Reddit from October of 2018 in
        order to see if a basic network analysis of those comments could improve
        the accuracy of a bot identifcation classifier. After locating a labeled
        set of users who identified as bots, we extracted a traditional set of
        text-based features - the number of user comments, time posted, number of
        unique subreddits, etc - and perfomed a classification using both a Support
        Vector Machine and a Random Forest Classifier. We then created a network
        from the same dataset, nodes being individual users and directed edges
        linking when one user commented on another's post. We then extracted
        features from the resulting network such as Node Degree, Ego Density,
        Clustering Coefficient, and Triadic Census. Additional classification
        was performed on network features alone, as well as in conjunction with
        traditional text features to see if the addition of network analysis
        could improve the accuracy of the classifiers. The resulting analysis
        indicated on average a 2% increase in accuracy with the addition of the
        network.

        regarding that data with analysis and visualizations from the Python
        libraries Pandas and Seaborn. My data came from the

        This project is intended as a cumulative assessment of concepts covered
        in SI 506 - Introduction to Python. Required components were accessing
        two different APIs, defining class instances, demonstrating sorting, and
        creating a human-readable output file. My implementation in particular
        uses a console input to prompt the user for a query with which to search
        the <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/">New York Times API</a>. The
        first 10 responses from the API are displayed to the user, sorted by age
        in days. The user is then prompted to select an article, the keywords of
        which are used to search the Flickr API for pictures which may be related
        to the article's content. The output consists of a simple HTML page
        containing the selected article's title, a brief summary, and a list of
        photos with associated keywords.

        This project is a demonstration of our understanding of concepts covered
        in SI 507 - Intermediate Python: APIs, web scraping and SQL. We were
        offered a fair bit of leeway in our choice of project, as long as it met
        the basic criteria of obtaining and collating data from multiple sources
        and displaying it to the user. I chose to pull data on movies from
        multiple sources -
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data">a large set of .csv files from Kaggle</a>,
        the <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">Open Movie Database API</a>, and
        Wikipedia - in order to create a data set from which the user can query.
        Data from these sources was pulled using several python scripts,
        utilizing the Requests and
        <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a>
        libraries, and inserted into a SQLite database. The database allows
        references to be made between various movies, user reviews, and cast &
        crew data pulled from the data sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user interface is a web application, utilizing the python
        <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask Microframework</a>,
        with templates and POST requests to allow a user to sort and filter data,
        as well as navigate to pages by movie title or cast/crew name. Data is
        pulled from the SQLite database and displayed using a mix of html tables
        and the
        <a href="https://plot.ly/javascript/">plotly.js library</a> to display a
        variety of simple graphs based on SQL queries constructed based on the
        html forms. A detailed readme is also provided on the github repository.

        element of interactivity to aspects of the site.

        quiz administrator is able to see graphical representations of the

        manner in which quizzes were stored in the database - the quizzes had been stored
        in plain-text GIFT format, however the results view requires the results of all quiz
        takers in serialized JSON alongside it, which required a minor change to the
        data model of the quiz module.

        The final project from SI 582 - Introduction to Interaction Design.
        Throughout the semester, we developed and refined the design of a
        theoretical mobile application. My particular project was a tracking
        application for groceries, with the goal of reducing household waste from
        expiring food.  Starting with developing storyboards and personas, we
        eventually moved to creating a wireframe and then finally a fully
        interactable prototype.
