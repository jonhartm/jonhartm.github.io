        This project is intended as a cumulative assesment of concepts covered
        in SI 506 - Introduction to Python. Required components were accessing
        two different APIs, defining class instances, demonstrate sorting, and
        creating an output file. My inplementation in particular uses a console
        input to prompt the user for a query with which to search the New York
        Times API. The first 10 responses from the API are displayed to the
        user, sorted by age in days. The user is then prompted to select an
        article, the keywords of which are used to search the Flickr API for
        pictures which may be related to the article's content. The output
        consists of a simple HTML page containing the selected article's title,
        a brief summary, and a list of photos with associated keywords.

      <h2>SI507 Final Project</h2>
      <h3>Python, SQL</h3>
      <p>
        This project is a demonstration of our understanding of concepts covered
        in SI 507 - Intermediate Python: APIs, web scraping and SQL. We were
        offered a fair bit of leeway in our choice of project, as long as it met
        the basic criteria of obtaining and coallating data from multiple sources
        and displaing it to the user. I chose to pull data on movies from
        multiple sources - a large set of .csv files from Kaggle, the Open Movie
        database API, and Wikipedia - in order to create a data set from which
        the user can query.

        You're looking at it. We were asked to create a multi-page personal
        portfolio site from scratch to demonstrate our understanding of HTML,
        CSS and related languages. For my site in particular I put a particular
        emphasis on SASS as an alternative to CSS coding, and jQuery to add an
        element of interactivity to aspects of the site.

        We were asked, with a partner, to give a webinar-style presentation to a
        group of classmates using the bluejeans interactive presentation software.
        The topic of the presentation was really secondary - the emphasis of the
        project was on planning and desiging an engaging presentation within a
        given timeframe.

        An attempt to extend the existing quiz module from the TSUGI project to
        provide the instructor with statistics to obtain a more detailed
        formative assesment. Parses and stores the quiz results from each
        student as the quiz is attempted in the module's database entry. The
        quiz administrator is able to see graphical representations of the
        collective results to identify questions which were frequently missed,
        as well as a detailed look at each question to see common mis-conceptions
        students may have had.

        An attempt to make the user interface for the existing TSUGI quiz module
        more approachable. The original interface uses the Moodle GIFT file
        format input in plain text, which some prospective users found either
        intimidating or more complicated than they were interested in. At the same
        time, existing users indicated a preference for an all-keyboard entry.
        As a compromise, I designed a html form that allowed for mouse and
        keyboard entry, while allowing confident users to quickly tab through
        entry fields.

        A hobby project for my spare time. Using C# and the OpenTK framework,
        creating a very simple 2D graphics engine in OpenGL. More an exercise
        than a real project, I enjoy the challenge of interacting with a state
        machine in an object-oriented language in the most efficient way
        possible.

        The final project from SI 582 - Introduction to Interaction Design.
        Throughout the semester, we developed and refined the design of a
        theoretical mobile application. My particular project was a tracking
        application for groceries, with the goal of reducing household waste from
        expireing food.  Starting with developing storyboards and personas, we
        eventually moved to creating a wireframe and then finally a fully
        interactable prototype.
